| [HL7 CDA® R2 Implementation Guide: National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Reports for Long Term Care Facilities (HAI-LTCF-CDA), Release 1- US Realm](http://www.hl7.org/special/Committees/projman/searchableProjectIndex.cfm?action=edit&ProjectNumber=1511)    | This project developed an implementation guide constraining CDA Release 2. The implementation guide supports electronic submission of HAI LTCF data to the National Healthcare Safety Network.|
| [HL7 FHIR® Implementation Guide: Healthcare Associated Infection Reports, Release 1 - US Realm](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/hai/index.html)| This implementation guide (IG) is to specifies standards for electronic submission of Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) reports to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This IG contains a library of FHIR profiles for electronic submission of HAI reports to the NHSN. |
| [US Core Implementation Guide (v3.0.0)](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html)    | The US Core Implementation Guide is based on [FHIR Version 4.0.0](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html) and defines the minimum conformance requirements for accessing patient data The Argonaut pilot implementations, [ONC 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS)](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2015Ed_CCG_CCDS.pdf) and the latest proposed [ONC U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/laws-regulation-and-policy/notice-proposed-rulemaking-improve-interoperability-health) provided the requirements for this guide. These profiles are the foundation for future US Realm FHIR implementation guides. In addition to Argonaut, they are used by [DAF-Research](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/daf-research/index.html), [QI-Core](https://oncprojectracking.healthit.gov/wiki/display/TechLabSC/CQF+Home), and [CIMI](http://www.opencimi.org/). Under the guidance of HL7 and the HL7 US Realm Steering Committee, the content will expand in future versions to meet the needs specific to the US Realm.|
