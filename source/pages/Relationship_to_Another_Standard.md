HL7 has developed this FHIR Implementation Guide in parallel with the existing CDA Implementation Guide.We anticipate several STU releases on the path to a Normative Release 1 of the HL7 Implementation Guide for CDA and FHIR for Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Reports from Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF). The FHIR and CDA implementation guides will align. A change to one standard will require the same change in the other standard. 

In this release, the new forms included in both the CDA and FHIR standards are:
* Laboratory-identified MDRO or CDI Event for LTCF Report
* MDRO and CDI LabID Event Reporting: Monthly Summary Data for LTCF
