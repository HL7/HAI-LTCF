HL7 has developed this FHIR implementation guide in parallel with the CDA implementation guide. We anticipate several STU releases on the path to a Normative Release 1 of the HL7 implementation guides for CDA and FHIR for Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Reports from Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF). The FHIR and CDA implementation guides will align. A change to one standard will require the same change in the other standard. 

In this release, the new forms included in both the CDA and FHIR standards are:
* **NHSN HAI LTCF Population Summary Report**: MDRO and CDI LabID Event Reporting Monthly Summary Data for LTCF
* **NHSN HAI LTCF Single-Person Event Report**: Laboratory-identified MDRO or CDI Event for LTCF

For further details see the [NHSN website](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/) for reporting healthcare-associated infections in long-term care facilities.
