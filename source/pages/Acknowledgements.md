This implementation guide was produced and developed by Lantana Consulting Group in conjunction with the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion in the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Its development and deployment are results of the dedication of the team—led by Daniel A. Pollock, M.D., Surveillance Branch Chief, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, NCEZID, CDC and  Jeneita Bell, MD, MPH, Long-term Care Team Lead, DHWP, NCEZID, CDC—and their support of the development of interoperable data standards for the CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).
